/**
 * `merge-queue-classify` core — the pure, IO-free classifier for ship-it Step 5.5's
 * bounded post-enqueue reconcile (issue #1921).
 *
 * ship-it enqueues a PR to GitHub's merge queue and then watches a bounded batch window
 * to classify the terminal state (ADR
 * [0132](../../../../../.decisions/0132-merge-queue-for-base-freshness.md)): did the
 * queue land the batch (`merged`), is the PR still in the queue (`queued`), did the
 * queue drop it without merging (`ejected`), or is it still settling into the queue
 * (`pending`)? The old discriminator inferred `ejected` from a momentary
 * `mergeStateStatus != QUEUED` while OPEN — but a freshly-enqueued PR reads
 * `mergeStateStatus = CLEAN` for a few seconds *before* GitHub flips it CLEAN → QUEUED,
 * so a genuinely-queued PR was FALSE-classified `ejected` on the first poll (the #1906
 * live instance: an ejection comment posted on a healthy queued PR, then retracted by
 * hand).
 *
 * The fix keys the verdict off the **authoritative** merge-queue signal — the REST
 * issue-timeline events GitHub emits: `added_to_merge_queue` on enqueue and
 * `removed_from_merge_queue` on a genuine ejection (GitHub "Managing a merge queue";
 * verified live against these events on PR #1906). Classification is **last-merge-queue-
 * event-wins**, which also survives a re-enqueue (add → remove → add ⇒ still queued).
 * `mergeStateStatus` is retained only as a *positive* still-queued hint (`QUEUED`),
 * never as the ejection discriminator.
 *
 * The IO lives in `command.ts` (the thin bin, which reads the PR state + timeline via
 * `gh`); this file is the pure predicate over already-resolved ground-truth signals so
 * the classification contract is unit-testable without a live queue (ADR 0082; the
 * core-in-its-own-file idiom, #855).

 *   2. `ejected` — NOT merged AND last merge-queue event is `removed_from_merge_queue`.
 *      This is the ONLY ejection signal: a genuine dequeue, not a momentary state read.
 *   3. `queued` — NOT merged AND (last event `added_to_merge_queue` OR
 *      mergeStateStatus==QUEUED). A well-formed pending in the queue; keep polling.
 *   4. `pending` — NOT merged AND no merge-queue event yet (the settle window, incl.
 *      OPEN + CLEAN before the QUEUED flip). The #1906 race. NEVER `ejected`.
