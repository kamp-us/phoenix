/**
 * `FateDataView` — the class factory for fate data views, plus the `Entity`
 * type helper.
 *
 * The problem this solves (the TS2883 spike): fate's `dataView()` return type
 * is `DataView<Item> & {readonly [dataViewFieldsKey]: Fields}` — and neither
 * `DataView` nor the unique symbol is exported from `@nkzw/fate/server`, so an
 * **exported** raw view const trips tsgo's declaration-nameability checks
 * (TS2883/TS4023) in any composite project (the worker is one). The historical
 * dodge — annotating with `SourceDefinition<Item>["view"]` — erases the
 * literal field map, which kills fate's `Entity<>` derivation and forced the
 * worker's hand-rolled `EntityOf` restatement.
 *
 * The factory keeps both properties at once:
 *
 * - **The static `view` IS the kernel `dataView()` output, unchanged** — the
 *   exact object, plain and codegen-walkable (fate's `collectDataViewConfigs`
 *   skips anything `typeof !== "object"`, so the class itself can never pose
 *   as the view; it carries it).
 * - **The class declaration is the nameable type** — `typeof TermView` names
 *   the full inferred shape (literal field map included) through this module's
 *   portable aliases, so exporting views stops being a TS2883 hazard and
 *   `Entity<typeof TermView>` has full fidelity.
 *
 * Authoring shape (fate's curry, plus Effect's dummy-call — TypeScript has no
 * partial type-argument inference, so the row type and the literal name must
 * bind on separate calls; same reason `Schema.TaggedErrorClass<Self>()(...)`
 * takes one):
 *
 * ```ts
 * class TermView extends FateDataView<TermRow>()("Term")({
 *   id: true,
 *   slug: true,
 *   definitions: FateDataView.list(DefinitionView, {orderBy: [{score: "desc"}]}),
 * }) {}
 *
 * type Term = Entity<typeof TermView>;
 * ```
