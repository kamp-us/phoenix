/**
 * `provideRequestPair` — THE per-request provision pipeline, spelled once
 * (consumed by `Executor.ts` `runResolve`, `Interpreter.ts` `runOperation`,
 * and `Walk.ts` `provide`).
 *
 * The invariant, in one place: the two genuinely per-request services come
 * off the request context as VALUES — `CurrentUser` from the session,
 * `LivePublisher` from the request's execution context — provided innermost
 * so the request values always win; the build-time services captured by
 * `FateServer.layer` (`service.services`) sit beneath. No per-request layer,
 * no runtime rebuild, no context smuggling.
 *
 * erased→kernel: the trailing cast re-pins the erased entry effect's
 * requirements to `never` so a runtime can run it. The erased shapes carry
 * `R = unknown` (the covariant top — every entry assigns into the config
 * records); the REAL requirements were enforced where they are enforceable:
 * the handler's own definition site typed them, `FateServer.layer`'s public
 * R surfaced their union minus the per-request pair, and the layer could not
 * have produced a runtime without discharging it. A genuinely missing
 * service still fails loudly at run time ("Service not found"), never
 * silently. This is the package's ONE spelling of that request-pipeline
 * re-pin — the call sites carry none.
 *
 * Package-internal: not exported from the barrel (no exported value's type
 * surfaces it; the repo-root typecheck gate guards TS2883).
