/**
 * crew/session — THE runnable stdio entry the cutover binds (#3062): stand up one live crew
 * session's `McpServer` over stdio + its channel peer, so every inter-session seam that used to
 * ride the tmux relay convention (claim/collision-check, planned-epic handoff, drain tally,
 * intake pings, role discovery/presence, the role-uniqueness lease) now runs over the channels
 * protocol instead of buffer-paste + staggered-submit + pane-title discovery + capture-pane
 * identity verification.
 *
 * #3059 built the composition (`makeCrewChannel`) but deliberately left this live entry out; this
 * module binds it. The ONE running stdio `McpServer` drives BOTH edges of the channel:
 *   - outbound — the `channel_send` toolkit, its `ChannelSend` port bound to THIS session's peer,
 *     so a role addresses a peer by role (never a tmux window/pane) and the send dials it directly,
 *   - inbound  — the peer-inbox socket server whose deliveries wake the session through
 *     `ChannelSink.layerFromMcpServer` (the same running server), rendered as a `<channel>` tag.
 * Both edges share one `McpServer` instance by layer memoization (the shared `server` value), so
 * the toolkit registers on, and the sink wakes through, the exact transport serving stdio — the
 * same memoization the edge server (#3162) relies on when it provides `layerStdio` to the toolkit.
 *
 * The per-kind cardinality lease + presence announce ride the peer's scope (`makeCrewChannel`): a
 * second live session for a held BRIDGE role fails the build with `RoleUniquenessError`, an ENGINE
 * role admits N instances, and presence frees on teardown (connection-is-lease, #3035). A bridge's
 * address is its role (`inbox://<role>`) — its singleton lease keeps discover→dial deterministic;
 * an engine's is per-instance (`inbox://<role>/<instance>`) so its pool never collapses. See
 * `inboxAddressFor` (ADR 0189).
 *
 * The binding is transport-injected: `channelSendFromPeer` takes the peer substrate as a
 * requirement (production supplies `peerSocketSubstrate` over unix sockets), so `session.test.ts`
 * drives the exact `ChannelSend`-from-peer binding fully in-memory (an `RpcTest` `CrewTracker` + an
 * in-memory `Connect`) — the same transport-free idiom `channel-server.test.ts` uses. The one seam
 * not exercised without a live MCP client is the stdio `McpServer` wake itself.
