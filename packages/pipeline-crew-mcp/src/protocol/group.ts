 * (claim/collision-check, role lookup) set a `success` schema — a typed reply the
 * caller awaits; the fire-and-forget kinds leave `success` unset, so it defaults to
 * `Schema.Void` (effect-smol `Rpc.ts` — `const successSchema = options?.success ?? Schema.Void`).
 * That success/void split is exactly what distinguishes a request-response kind from a
