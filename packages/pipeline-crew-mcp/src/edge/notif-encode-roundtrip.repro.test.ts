// @patch-pin: effect@4.0.0-beta.92
/**
 * End-to-end run-loop pin for the (b1) hunk of `patches/effect@4.0.0-beta.92.patch` (#3491, ADR 0038).
 * The sibling `notif-encode.repro.test.ts` pins the encode STRATEGY (by-tag vs blind union) by reading
 * the schemas directly; this one drives the REAL patched `McpServer` run-loop end-to-end over the
 * bidirectional notification transport and asserts the params a `claude/channel` wake carries survive
 * to the wire. That closes the coverage gap #3494 names: the strategy pin stays GREEN even if the
 * run-loop hunk alone were reverted (the schema still exists on `main`), so the load-bearing run-loop
 * change had no automated regression guard — a patch regeneration could silently revert it.
 *
 * The teeth: the pre-fix loop encoded every outgoing notification against a blind
 * `Schema.Union(...payloadSchema)` in which the all-optional `*_list_changed` members accept any object
 * and strip unknown keys, and they sit before `claude/channel` — so a `{content, meta}` channel payload
 * matched a `list_changed` member first and encoded to `{}`, shipping the wake with empty params (0
 * tokens). This test fires a wake carrying BOTH `content` and `meta` and asserts the emitted wire line's
 * `params` is `{content, meta}` INTACT — RED against the blind-union loop (params `{}`), GREEN on the
 * by-tag fix. Reverting the b1 hunk alone keeps the drain (#3499) and id-omit (#3495) hunks in place, so
 * the line still emits — it just arrives stripped, failing the params assertion.
 *
 * Faithful LIVE-path harness, mirroring `notif-drain-emit.repro.test.ts`: boots the real
 * `McpServer.layerStdio` (the transport `bin.ts session` serves) over a fake `Stdio`, feeds the
 * `initialize` + `notifications/initialized` handshake into stdin so the drain gate is armed, then fires
 * the wake through the running server and reads the captured stdout. `it.live` (not `it.effect`): the
 * forked run-loop drives `Effect.sleep` on REAL async scheduling, which `TestClock` would freeze. Retire
 * when effect ships a native custom-notification passthrough and the patch is removed.
