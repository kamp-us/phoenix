 * edge never constructs a peer (the crew composition root does, #3059). A send to a role with
 * no live peer surfaces as `PeerUnreachableError`; a send to a role that is present but whose
 * inbox will not answer surfaces as `ChannelDeafError` (#3628) — both returned as an error result
 * to the caller, never a silent drop (#3035).
