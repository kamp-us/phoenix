/**
 * Type-level assertion (no runtime — checked by `tsgo`, not vitest): an op that
 * declares a capability in its requirements channel **fails to compile** unless
 * the proof is discharged via `Grant.provide` at composition. This is the
 * "forgot to authorize is a compile error" guarantee of ADR 0107 §1, made
 * falsifiable by inspecting the **R channel** with `expectTypeOf`: omit
 * `Grant.provide` and the capability stays required in R (≠ `never`); provide it
 * and R collapses to `never`. The assertion is a real `tsgo` error the moment
 * either half stops holding. (#1270 collapsed the per-capability `.provide` to a
 * single generic `Grant.provide`; the forgot-to-provide guarantee is unchanged.)
 *
 * It reads R off the effect type rather than asserting an *assignment* (the prior
 * `@ts-expect-error`'d `leaked` form): assigning a service-requiring effect to an
 * `R = never` annotation tripped the plugin's `effect(missingEffectContext)`
 * diagnostic (TS377004), which `@ts-expect-error` does not catch — leaving the
 * typetest itself red. Inspecting the channel proves the same guarantee cleanly.
