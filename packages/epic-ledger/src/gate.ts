/**
 * The deterministic `review-plan` gate action (ADR 0047, issue #164).
 *
 * Given an epic number: fetch its `EpicLedger` through the `Github` capability,
 * run `validateLedger`, and branch on the hard-defect set:
 *
 *   - **zero defects** → flip every `status:planned` child to `status:triaged`
 *     (the children become pickable by `write-code`) and post a PASS verdict;
 *   - **≥1 defect** → post a per-defect FAIL verdict and flip **nothing**.
 *
 * The action mutates only child labels (on a pass) and its own verdict comment —
 * never the brief, the topology, or the sub-issue links (Decision 1 + "Banned"
 * in ADR 0047). It is flag-not-repair: it signals; the re-plan loop (#166) owns
 * any repair. The returned `GateVerdict` is the structured result the loop reads
 * to decide whether to converge, re-plan, or park.
