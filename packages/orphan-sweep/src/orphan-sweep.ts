/**
 * `@kampus/orphan-sweep` pure core — turn the live set of Cloudflare resources into a
 * deletion plan that bounds the integration-stage leak (#690) WITHOUT ever touching a
 * protected resource. IO-free and total: every function here is a deterministic
 * transform over already-listed `CfResource[]` + a protection set; the CF/`gh`
 * boundary lives in `cloudflare.ts`/`github.ts`, and this module never deletes
 * anything itself.
 *
 * Why a leak exists (#690, carved out of #689): integration teardown is
 * `afterAll(destroy(...))`. A partial `beforeAll` deploy can orphan its remote D1; the
 * #689 run-unique stage names mean a later run never overwrites it, so orphans
 * ACCUMULATE on the one shared account. This sweep is the bound: it deletes the
 * ephemeral integration (`it-*`) resources, the preview (`pr-<n>`) resources of
 * CLOSED PRs, and — behind a separate opt-in — the stale `test`/`test-*` dev/test
 * stage resources (#2340), and protects everything else. The `dev`/`dev-*` named-dev
 * stages are deny-by-protection and never swept, flag or not.
 *
 * The safety property is the whole point. A sweep that deletes a prod, named-dev, or
 * open-PR resource is catastrophic and irreversible (ADR 0032: these are REAL remote
 * D1s, never emulated). So matching is allow-by-pattern + deny-by-protection, both
 * anchored, and exhaustively unit-tested.

/**

 * never carries one). The pure core only ever reads the stage-bearing name; the extra
 * `appId`/`appName` coordinates are boundary delete-keys it ignores.
 *
 * Worker scripts and D1 databases leak by stage in their OWN physical name. Flagship
 * resources leak the same way per closed PR preview, but a flag's KEY is stage-invariant
 * (the same `key` declared on every stage's app — `apps/web/worker/features/flagship/resources.ts`),
