# alchemy-effect: the infra layer

How phoenix's Cloudflare infrastructure is declared and wired. The short answer: instead of `wrangler.jsonc` + a raw `export default {fetch}` worker + `env.PHOENIX_DB`-style binding access + hand-written Durable Object classes, the whole worker is **one Effect program** — [alchemy-effect](https://github.com/usirin/alchemy-effect) — where the same code that *declares* a binding at deploy time *is* the typed client at runtime.

> **These `alchemy-*` docs describe the live `apps/web/worker/`.** The `effect-*` and `fate-*` docs describe the domain and protocol layers riding on top, unchanged by the infra; these describe the bottom layer — the worker, its bindings, the DOs, routing, and deploy. Where a doc and the source disagree, the source wins — fix the doc.

## Not an Effect migration

phoenix is on effect v4; so is alchemy-effect (`effect@4.0.0-*`). The domain layer doesn't change conceptually. What alchemy owns is the **seam between the domain and Cloudflare** — the column below shows what each concern looked like under the old wrangler/Hono shape vs how it works now:

| Concern | Old wrangler/Hono shape | On alchemy-effect (current) |
|---|---|---|
| Bindings, DOs, migrations, assets | declared in `wrangler.jsonc` | declared as resources in one Effect program (`alchemy.run.ts` + the worker) |
| Reaching a binding | `env.PHOENIX_DB`, `env.CONNECTION_DO` | `yield* Cloudflare.D1Connection.bind(PhoenixDb)`, `yield* ConnectionDO` |
| Worker entry | `export default {fetch: app.fetch}` (Hono) | `export default class Phoenix extends Cloudflare.Worker<Phoenix>()(...)` |
| HTTP routing | Hono `app.get/post` | `HttpRouter` + `HttpApiBuilder` (`@effect/platform`) |
| Runtime | `ManagedRuntime.make(...)` built + disposed per request | ONE worker-level `ManagedRuntime`, built once per isolate and never disposed (ADR 0041) |
| Durable Objects | plain `class extends DurableObject` | `Cloudflare.DurableObjectNamespace<T>()(...)` (Effect handlers) |
| Deploy | `wrangler deploy` | `alchemy deploy` |

**Untouched by the infra:** every `effect-*` doc (services, errors, tracing, testing), and the *shape* of the `fate-*` protocol layer — data views, sources, mutations, operations. The one fate-side consequence is the runtime shape: the one worker-level `ManagedRuntime` plus the two per-request VALUES (`currentUser`, `livePublisher`), rather than a fresh per-request runtime — see [alchemy-runtime.md](./alchemy-runtime.md).

## The two phases

Every alchemy resource — a `Worker`, a `DurableObjectNamespace` — is defined by an outer Effect that runs in **two phases**:

```ts
export default class Phoenix extends Cloudflare.Worker<Phoenix>()(
  "phoenix",
  {main: import.meta.filename, assets: "./dist/client", /* … */},
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    // ── INIT PHASE (deploy time + once per isolate) ──
    // Bind resources. At deploy time this records binding metadata for the
    // Cloudflare API; at runtime it resolves typed clients.
    const db = yield* Cloudflare.D1Connection.bind(PhoenixDb);
    const connections = yield* ConnectionDO;
    const topics = yield* TopicDO;

    return {
      // ── RUNTIME PHASE (per request) ──
      fetch: /* an Effect<HttpServerResponse, …> — usually HttpRouter.toHttpEffect(layer) */,
    };
  }).pipe(Effect.provide(/* binding Live layers */)),
) {}
```

The init phase is where `bind()` happens; the runtime phase is the handlers it returns. The single most important consequence: **bindings resolved in init are in scope for the whole worker lifetime**, so worker-wide singletons (the `Drizzle` service, the feature services) are built once in init, not per request. See [alchemy-runtime.md](./alchemy-runtime.md).

## How the layers map onto phoenix

phoenix has three layers (see [index.md](./index.md)). alchemy-effect sits *under* them:

- **Effect domain layer** (`effect-*`) — services, errors, layers. Transport- *and* infra-agnostic.
- **fate protocol + client layer** (`fate-*`) — data views, sources, mutations, live views. The only infra-facing detail is the worker-level `ManagedRuntime` the compile step runs handlers through.
- **alchemy infra layer** (these `alchemy-*` docs) — the worker, its bindings, the DOs, the HTTP router, deploy. The bottom layer; `worker/index.ts` is the alchemy worker, and there is no `wrangler.jsonc` or Hono shell.

## Reading order

1. [alchemy-worker.md](./alchemy-worker.md) — the `Cloudflare.Worker` class and its two phases.
2. [alchemy-bindings.md](./alchemy-bindings.md) — `bind()`, the deploy-policy/runtime-service split, the Live-layer convention.
3. [alchemy-runtime.md](./alchemy-runtime.md) — **the load-bearing doc.** Worker-level vs request-scoped layers, the one worker-level `ManagedRuntime`, the fate seam.
4. [alchemy-http-router.md](./alchemy-http-router.md) — `HttpRouter` + `HttpApiBuilder`, mounting fate/auth/SSE.
5. [alchemy-durable-objects.md](./alchemy-durable-objects.md) — the Effect DO model; `ConnectionDO`/`TopicDO`.
6. [alchemy-drizzle-d1.md](./alchemy-drizzle-d1.md) — D1 + Drizzle + migrations.
7. [alchemy-stack-deploy.md](./alchemy-stack-deploy.md) — `alchemy.run.ts`, the `Stack`, dev/deploy.
