/**
 * The fate wire-error `code` vocabulary — the one canonical name for the error
 * `code` string that crosses the worker↔SPA boundary.
 *
 * The worker derives these from the `FateWireCode` annotations on its error
 * classes (`@kampus/fate-effect`'s `encodeWireError`, `.patterns/fate-effect-wire-errors.md`);
 * the SPA narrows incoming codes to this union with {@link decodeFateWireCode}
 * so UI code can `switch` on a typed value instead of stringly comparing
 * against `"UNAUTHORIZED"` etc. The literal tuple is the authored source — a
 * runtime `Set<string>` (what the server's `declaredWireCodes` walk yields)
 * cannot give an exhaustive-`switch`-able union, so the SPA carries the literal
 * and the worker's `wireCodes.unit.test.ts` derives `declaredWireCodes(fateConfig)`
 * and fails CI if this list omits any code the server can emit — the two ends of
 * the wire contract are bound by that guard, not by hope.
 *
 * This module lives under `src/lib/` and is cross-included by the worker
 * tsconfig so both halves of the codec — and the coverage guard — agree on the
 * same constant.
