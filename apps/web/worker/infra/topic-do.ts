/**
 * `TopicDO` — the topic-role half of phoenix's live fan-out (ADR 0023, split per
 * ADR 0025), on alchemy's Effect Durable Object model (ADR 0028).
 *
 * One instance per topic, named `topic:<topicKey>`. It owns the **durable
 * subscriber registry** for that topic (in `state.storage.sql`), the **publish
 * fan-out**, and the **alarm reap** — nothing about any client's SSE stream.
 * The algorithm (generation-based stale detection, the consecutive-miss reap, the
 * bounded fan-out) is a verbatim port of the legacy `cloudflare:workers` class;
 * the behavior lives in `makeTopicInstance` (`live-instance.ts`), this file is
 * the inline-form `DurableObjectNamespace` declaration that wires it up.
 *
 * **Inline form is mandatory** — the modular `.make()` form is unimplemented for
 * DOs in alchemy@2.0.0-beta.44 (ADR 0028). The `ConnectionDO` sibling is resolved
 * **lazily inside `publish`/`alarm`** (`yield* ConnectionDO` per call) and
 * addressed by name (`getByName(\`connection:${id}\`)`) — never `yield*
 * ConnectionDO` in the init block (an eager circular `yield*` OOMs the build) and
 * never `idFromName`/`idFromString`/`get` (unavailable on the alchemy stub).

 * **function** (not a module-top-level const) for two reasons: (1) referencing
 * the sibling's full class type would form a circular type cycle, so the cast is
 * the seam that breaks it; (2) the import is genuinely circular at runtime, so a
 * top-level `ConnectionDO` access would hit the temporal dead zone while
 * `connection-do.ts` is still evaluating — deferring the read to call time (well
 * after both modules have loaded) sidesteps that (ADR 0028).
