/**
 * The single phoenix worker, on alchemy-effect (ADR 0026–0031).
 *
 * `export default class Phoenix extends Cloudflare.Worker<Phoenix>()(id, props, body)`.
 * The body runs in two phases: the init phase binds resources (D1 + the two
 * live-fan-out Durable Object namespaces) once per isolate; the runtime phase
 * returns the `fetch` handler — an `HttpRouter` compiled with
 * `HttpRouter.toHttpEffect`. The SPA is served from the `assets` prop, with
 * `runWorkerFirst` keeping the worker-owned paths (`/api/*`, `/fate`, `/fate/*`)
 * from being intercepted by the SPA shell.
 *
 * This replaces `wrangler.jsonc` (bindings/DOs/migrations/assets/vars) and the
 * Hono `export default {fetch}` entry. FOUNDATION SLICE (alchemy-migration task
 * 1): only `GET /api/health` is wired. The fate data plane, better-auth, the
 * admin seeders, and the live SSE route are ported onto this worker in tasks
 * 2–5 (the modules still live under `worker/fate/` and `worker/features/`).
 *
 * Dev vs prod for the SPA (ADR 0030): the `assets` + `runWorkerFirst` config
 * below is the *production* single-worker precedence — at the Cloudflare edge,
 * non-worker paths are answered by the asset server and the worker only sees the
 * `runWorkerFirst` globs. In the local dev loop `vite dev` serves the SPA (with
 * HMR) and proxies `/api` + `/fate*` to this worker (task 6); under bare
 * `alchemy dev` this worker is API-only, so a non-API path has no SPA to return.
