/**
 * `GET /api/flags/probe` — the end-to-end demonstrator for the boolean
 * dark-ship primitive (epic #488, #508). It reads one boolean flag through the
 * `Flags` domain service and **branches** on its value, proving the
 * infra→service→request slice serves a server-gated code path.
 *
 * It builds the per-request {@link FlagsContext} via `makeRequestFlagsContext`
 * (the session's user id for stable bucketing, plus the deploy `environment`
 * sourced from the stage — #512) and provides it inline — the per-request
 * evaluation context supplied alongside `Auth` (ADR 0029), not at isolate scope.
 * With no session it falls back to the anonymous identity. The flag is
 * undeclared, so evaluation returns the safe default (`false` → the off branch);
 * a server with the flag on would return the on branch.
