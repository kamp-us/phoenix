/**
 * `ReportReceipt` — the `report.submit` acknowledgement, NOT a re-resolved

 * 0082), so the mutation returns a small typed ack instead of a cached entity:
 * which target was reported and whether this call created a fresh row (`false`
 * on the idempotent re-report no-op). The synthetic `id` is the
 * `<targetKind>:<targetId>` key, stable per target so the client normalizes the
 * receipt to one record. Mirrors `LandingStats` — a result-only data view with
 * no source/fetch path. See `.patterns/fate-effect-data-views.md`.
