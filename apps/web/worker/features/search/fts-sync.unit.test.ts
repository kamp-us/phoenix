/**
 * Unit tests for the FTS dual-write sync (ADR 0080) — no workerd. Pins three
 * invariants the live write→sync→read loop depends on:
 *
 *  1. The symmetric write/query fold: the `norm` text written into the FTS row
 *     folds the SAME way `normalizeSearchText` folds the resolver's query string,
 *     so a write and a later query meet on one token form.
 *  2. The statement shape: each sync is a delete-then-insert upsert (FTS5 has no
 *     `ON CONFLICT`), keyed by slug/id.
 *  3. Batch-safety against drizzle's REAL d1 batch builder (#863): the sync items
 *     must `_prepare()` to a `D1PreparedQuery` carrying a bound `.stmt`, so D1's
 *     `session.batch()` (`preparedQuery.stmt.bind(...params)`) builds them without
 *     throwing. The earlier `db.run(sql\`…\`)` shape yields a `SQLiteRaw` with no
 *     `.stmt`, which 500s the whole batch on real D1 — the prior unit fake (a
 *     recording `db.run`) never reached that builder path, so it sailed past. This
 *     test drives the real drizzle-d1 `batch()` over a recording D1 *client* (no
 *     SQL engine — ADR 0082), so a regression to a non-batchable item shape fails
 *     here, not only in remote integration.

 * collation behavior (those remain integration-tier facts). It records only the
 * statements drizzle's real d1 `batch()` builder *prepares and binds*, which is the
 * exact seam the #863 regression broke: a batch item must `_prepare()` to a
 * `D1PreparedQuery` whose `.stmt` the builder binds params onto. A query-builder
 * item has that `.stmt`; a `db.run(sql\`…\`)` `SQLiteRaw` does not, so the builder
 * throws before recording. The earlier recording-`db.run` fake never reached this
 * driver path, which is why the break sailed past unit and only 500'd on real D1.
