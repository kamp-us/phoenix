/**
 * Vote — the polymorphic vote service. One canonical write surface
 * (`Vote.cast`) for the three vote targets: `definition`, `post`, `comment`.
 *
 * Voting is up-only in the MVP: a vote is a pure presence — `cast({value: true})`
 * casts, `{value: false}` retracts — so invalid states (down-vote semantics, a
 * vote *weight*) are structurally unrepresentable; there is no number to misuse.
 *
 * The feature-local vote table (`definition_vote`/`post_vote`/`comment_vote`,
 * PK `(target_id, voter_id)`) is the score-truth source; the score cached on
 * the target row is rebuilt from `COUNT(*)` on it. The cross-product
 * `user_vote` table (PK `(user_id, target_kind, target_id)`) powers `myVote`.
 *
 * Atomicity invariant: every state-changing cast lands all four mutations —
 * vote-table upsert/delete, score-cache update, `user_vote` mirror, and karma
 * bump (via {@link KarmaBump}) — in one batch that commits or rolls back as a
 * unit. See ADR 0014 (batch as service method).
