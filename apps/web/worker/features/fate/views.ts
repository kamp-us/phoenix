/**
 * Root-level query/list operations the fate Vite plugin turns into typed client
 * roots (read with `useRequest`). A view-based entry is a `query` root; an entry
 * wrapped in `list(...)` is a `list` root. The plugin reads this **value** at
 * build time (`createSchema(views, Root)`) to emit the client roots; at runtime
 * each query root is a `query` operation resolved by its matching
 * `queries.<name>` resolver (so `Root` is not passed to `createFateServer` —
 * see `server.ts` for why `roots` stays empty there).
 *
 * `me` is the "current user" root (fate's documented `viewer` pattern): the
 * `userDataView` declares the shape, and `queries.me` (Auth-gated, reads the
 * canonical Pasaport row) backs it. The byId roots for the other entities are
 * generated from the source registry and don't need a `Root` entry; only
 * custom-resolver roots are declared here.
 *
 * Every screen's roots are declared here: sözlük
 * (`term`/`recentTerms`/`popularTerms`), pano (`post`/`posts`), and pasaport
 * (`profile`/`landingStats`). Each `Root` entry MUST be a `dataView` — the plugin
 * calls `ensureType(view)` on every root — so `landingStats` is backed by a
 * dedicated `landingStatsDataView` entity (a singleton with a constant `id`),
 * not the raw scalar shape. `health` stays off `Root` (no screen reads it).
 *
 * Annotated `Record<string, unknown>` so the export stays nameable: a precise
 * type would surface fate's internal `DataView` symbol (TS2883/TS4023, the same
 * non-portability the `*DataView` annotations dodge). The plugin only inspects
 * this value at runtime (`isDataView` checks), so the loose type is sufficient.
