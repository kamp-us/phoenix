/**
 * The fate ↔ Effect bridge.
 *
 * fate's resolvers and source handlers are plain async functions. phoenix's
 * domain lives in Effect `Context.Service`s. This module is the single seam
 * between them: a small helper family — `fateQuery`, `fateList`,
 * `fateMutation`, `fateSource` — wraps an Effect generator into the async
 * function fate expects.
 *
 * The F4 model (ADR 0029): there is ONE worker-level `ManagedRuntime`, built once
 * per isolate in worker init (`index.ts`) and carried on every {@link FateContext}
 * as `ctx.runtime`. The bridge runs each resolver THROUGH that runtime, providing
 * only the two genuinely per-request services — `Auth` (the validated session)
 * and `LiveBus` (the publish capability, ADR 0039) — onto each resolver effect
 * with `Effect.provideService`. Nothing is built or disposed per request, and
 * because resolvers run through the runtime their spans nest under the runtime's
 * request span rather than on a detached default-runtime root.
 *
 * **No `runPromiseExit` appears anywhere outside this file.** Resolvers and
 * executors are generators; the runner here does the
 * `provide(Auth/LiveBus) → run-on-runtime → Exit → wire-error` dance once.
 *
 * See `.patterns/fate-effect-bridge.md`, `.patterns/alchemy-runtime.md`, and
 * ADR 0016 / 0029.

 * the worker-level `ManagedRuntime` ({@link FateContext.runtime}), which supplies
 * the worker singletons (built once per isolate, never disposed per request).
 * Because the resolver runs THROUGH the runtime, its spans nest under the
 * runtime's request span (the F4 observability win) rather than on a detached
 * default-runtime root. The `Exit` resolves identically to before:
 *
 *   - `Exit.Success`            → the value.
 *   - tagged failure            → `encodeFateError` → throw (fate serializes it).
 *   - `FateRequestError`        → pass through verbatim (already wire-shaped).
 *   - defect (uncaught throw)   → `Cause.squash` → `encodeFateError` → throw.
 *
 * Generic in the runtime environment `R` (defaulting to the production worker
 * services) so a test can run a resolver on a tiny marker runtime; production
 * passes the default with zero churn. The effect's environment is `R | Auth |
 * LiveBus`; providing `Auth`/`LiveBus` here discharges those two, leaving exactly
 * `R` — the runtime's own environment.
 *
 * fate's `executeOperation` catches the throw and turns it into
 * `{ok: false, error: {code, message, issues?}}`.
