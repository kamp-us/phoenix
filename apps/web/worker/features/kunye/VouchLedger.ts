/**
 * `VouchLedger` — the D1-backed store of the authorship-vouch act (#1206, extended in
 * #1289): records a yazar's vouch for a çaylak (preserving the vouching actor), reads
 * back whether a vouch exists, counts a yazar's active vouches for the cap, and
 * withdraws a vouch. The recorded act is the `authorship_vouch` table; the AUTHORITY
 * to vouch (the yazar floor) is the {@link ./vouch.ts | Vouch} capability discharged
 * at the resolver, never here — this service is the persistence seam only (ADR 0013:
 * domain write in the service, the authority check at the gate).
 *
 * **Active-by-existence (#1289).** A vouch's lifecycle is encoded in the *presence* of
 * its row plus the candidate's tier — no `withdrawn`/`active` column, so #1289 reuses
 * the #1206 (migration 0013) schema with no migration. A vouch is **active** iff its
 * row exists *and* the candidate is still a `çaylak` (pending): `withdraw` deletes the
 * row (the slot returns), and a promotion flips the candidate to `yazar` (the row
 * persists as the successful-vouch record but no longer counts as active — the slot
 * also returns). "A withdrawn vouch" is therefore unrepresentable; the active set is
 * exactly `{rows whose candidate is still çaylak}`.
 *
 * Idempotency lives in the table: the composite PK `(voucher_id, candidate_id)` +
 * `onConflictDoNothing` makes a re-vouch by the same yazar a no-op success (the
 * `content_report` / `user_vote` precedent).
