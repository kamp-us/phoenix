/**
 * The **order-independent tandem resolver** (#1289, epic #1202) — the single code path
 * that flips a çaylak → yazar the moment *both* halves of the author-vouch tandem hold:
 * `(≥1 active vouch) AND (net karma ≥ VOUCH_PROMOTION_KARMA_BAR)`. It reads both halves
 * **fresh** from their stores and is **idempotent** (the flip is the atomic, guarded
 * `Pasaport.promoteToYazar`), so it is safe to call from *either* trigger in *either*
 * arrival order:
 *
 *   - the **vouch act** (`user.vouch`, this slice) — fired after a vouch is recorded, so
 *     a vouch placed while karma is already over the bar promotes immediately; and
 *   - the **karma side** (the vote-on-sandboxed path, #1288) — fired after a vote moves
 *     a çaylak's karma, so a bar-crossing vote with an already-active vouch promotes too.
 *
 * Both call THIS resolver, so promotion never depends on whether the vouch or the
 * bar-crossing vote landed first (the correctness property the two symmetric #1289
 * acceptance paths pin). The resolver holds **no authority of its own** — it is not a
 * capability; its only promotion trigger is the completed-tandem invariant it checks
 * here, exactly the "the yazar never holds a promote capability" rule (`.glossary/TERMS.md`:
 * the çaylak→yazar `Level` flip is not a yazar-held right). Callers gate reachability
 * behind the `PHOENIX_AUTHORSHIP_LOOP` dark-ship flag; the resolver itself is
 * unconditional, like the service reads it composes.
