// `user.tier` column read fresh through pasaport), NEVER from the `input:false`
// better-auth session additionalField (#1203/#1297). Always present — the value
// is not secret; the frontend gates rendering of authorship affordances on the
// `phoenix-authorship-loop` flag, not on the field's presence.
//
// `isModerator` is the SELF moderator signal (#1320): the resolver reads it
// server-side off the `moderates` `relation_tuple` (`kunye/moderate.ts`'s
// `isModerator`, the same tuple `Moderate.over(platform)` checks — never a
// retired `user.role` column, ADR 0107), keyed on the CURRENT user, so it is only
// ever the viewer's OWN mod status. Like `tier` it is always present (the divan
