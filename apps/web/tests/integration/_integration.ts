/**
 * Per-file integration lifecycle — the alchemy `Test.make` substrate (ADR 0082).
 *
 * Each integration test file calls `integrationStack(import.meta.url)` once at
 * module top level. It stands up a per-file `Test.make`, deploys the real phoenix
 * `Stack` to **real remote Cloudflare** under an **isolated stage** derived from the
 * file name, retries the first request through edge propagation, and returns the
 * black-box `harness` (`_harness.ts`) bound to that stage's worker URL. The deploy
 * runs in a `beforeAll(deploy(Stack, {stage}))`; teardown is
 * `afterAll.skipIf(NO_DESTROY)(destroy(Stack, {stage}))`.
 *
 * Per-file isolated stages are the whole point: each file owns its own worker + D1
 * (real, remote), freshly migrated by the existing
 * `D1Database({migrationsTable: "drizzle_migrations"})` resource the deploy applies
 * — one migration path. Files no longer share one long-lived deploy, so they run in
 * parallel instead of the forced single fork that raced itself (#547 / #220 / #560,
 * one root cause). D1 binds remote in `Test.make` (alchemy never emulates D1 — ADR
 * 0032/0082); real creds (`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` / `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` /
 * `ALCHEMY_PASSWORD`) come from the environment (CI secrets; a wrangler/alchemy
 * profile locally).
 *
 * `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` (a required `Config.redacted`, `worker/config.ts`) and
 * `ENVIRONMENT` are self-supplied below when absent — orthogonal to the harness
 * swap, retained from the prior model so the suite stays self-contained on a clean
 * runner.
